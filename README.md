## Moved to upstream distribution

`passmenu` is now part of the upstream `pass` distribution as
[`contrib/dmenu/passmenu`][upstream]. Please go there for future updates. :-)

---

`passmenu` is a [dmenu][]-based interface to [pass][], the standard Unix
password manager. This design allows you to quickly copy a password to the
clipboard without having to open up a terminal window if you don't already have
one open.
