Requires [`pass-otp`](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp)

Patched to support one-time password generation straight to clipboard.


## Moved to upstream distribution

`passmenu` is now part of `pass` itself! The script is available bundled at
[`contrib/dmenu/passmenu`][upstream]. Please go there for future updates.
